## Very high numbers over 120 ##

## Causes ## 


# 2) Timepoint randomisation to WLST cerebral causes < 68 h? If WLST neuro <68h, were there other causes for WLST such as ethical? 



#   Early-neuro:
#   1) If patient unconscious (FOUR-M <=3 on day 2), was a CT performed ≥20 h after randomisation?
#   2) Hours between randomisation and biomarker collection. N/A?
#   3) Was a continuous EEG and/or routine EEG performed ≤32 hours after randomisation?
#   4) If no EEG (continuous or routine) was performed ≤32 h after randomisation, was any EEG performed after this timepoint? If so, how many hours after randomisation?
#   5) Were biomarkers collected around 12 and 24 h after randomisation? Hours from randomisation to collection of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th samples.
